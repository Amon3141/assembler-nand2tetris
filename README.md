# Hack Assembler

Implementation of a hack assembler written in C++. A part of computer system learning using "Building a Modern Computer From First Principles" by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken. The implementation is not covered in the book (except for a few small tips), and this code was designed and written by me.
