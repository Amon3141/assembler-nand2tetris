# Hack Assembler

C++ implementation of a Hack assembler.
I wrote this while working through "Building a Modern Computer From First Principles" by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken. (https://www.nand2tetris.org/book)
The book does not give the implementation (except for a few small tips); this code was designed and written by me.

The example assembly files "Add.asm", "Pong.asm", and "Rect.asm" were provided in the book.
