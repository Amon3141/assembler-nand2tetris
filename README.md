# Hack Assembler

C++ implementation of the Hack assembler.
I wrote this while working through "Building a Modern Computer From First Principles" by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken. (https://www.nand2tetris.org/book)
The book does not give the implementation (except for a few small tips) so this code was fully written by me.

The example assembly files "Add.asm", "Pong.asm", and "Rect.asm" were provided in the book.
The hack files "Add.hack", "Pong.hack", and "Rect.hack" are the outputs of my assembler.
